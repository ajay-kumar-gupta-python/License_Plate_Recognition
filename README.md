# License_Plate_Recognition
This project implements an object detection system using PyTorch for license plate recognition, car counting, and car color detection. The system utilizes deep learning models to identify and analyze vehicles in images or videos.<br><br>

Features

        Car Counting: Count the number of cars present in a given scene or frame.
        License Plate Recognition (LPR): Detect and recognize license plates from vehicles in images or videos.
        Car Color Detection: Identify the predominant color of cars detected.

Technologies Used<br><br>

    Python: The core programming language used for development.
    PyTorch: Deep learning framework used for training and deploying object detection models.
    OpenCV: Library used for image and video processing tasks.
    Pre-trained Models: Utilize pre-trained models such as Faster R-CNN, YOLO, or SSD for object detection.
    Dataset: Use datasets containing images of vehicles and their annotations for training.

Usage<br>

    1.License Plate Recognition:
          Input an image or video containing vehicles.
          The system will detect and recognize license plates, displaying the results.
          
    2.Car Counting:
          Provide an image or video frame with vehicles.
          The system will count the number of cars present in the scene.
          
    3.Car Color Detection:
          Process an image or video frame containing cars.
          The system will identify and display the predominant color of the detected cars.
